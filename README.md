# VoiceText2SQL
 VoiceText2SQL is an innovative application that enables users to interact with a MySQL database using natural language voice commands or text input. The system utilizes advanced speech-to-text technology to transcribe audio queries into text, which are then processed to generate corresponding SQL queries.  With seamless integration of the LangChain framework and a powerful language model, VoiceText2SQL not only executes SQL queries but also provides human-readable responses based on the query results. The application features an intuitive interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to easily connect to their database and retrieve information without needing any SQL knowledge. Whether using voice or text, users can efficiently query their databases and receive instant insights, making database management accessible and user-friendly.
